This Chrome extension helps you plan your study schedule for YouTube playlists by calculating the total duration of the playlist and creating a personalized study plan based on your daily time commitment.

## Features

- Calculates the total duration of a YouTube playlist
- Generates a study plan based on your daily time commitment

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the `icon.png` file is present in the root directory of the extension. (This is a placeholder text file for testing purposes.)
3. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files.
6. The extension should now appear in your Chrome toolbar.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to a YouTube playlist page.
2. Click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar.
3. The popup will show the total duration of the playlist.
4. Enter your daily study time commitment in minutes.
5. Click "Generate Plan" to see how long it will take to complete the playlist.

## Notes

- Make sure you're on a YouTube playlist page for the extension to work correctly.
- The extension calculates the duration based on the visible videos in the playlist. For very long playlists, you may need to scroll down to load all videos for an accurate calculation.
- The current icon is a placeholder. For a production version, replace `icon.png` with a proper 48x48 pixel PNG image.

Enjoy your studying!
